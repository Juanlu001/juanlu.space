Here I am.

Tweets are deleting as we speak. Facebook and Whatsapp are long gone.
And, you guessed right, *I am back to blogging*.

I started a personal blog a long time ago.
Learning to program, to write, to love, to learn... It was another life.
That blog is no longer online. I don't like leaving traces.

Then I started a programming blog, and then another one. `That
one was quite famous <https://pybonacci.org>`_, a great ride.
I learned to teach, to talk to my audience,
and many other things along the way.

The present looks kinda gloomy though. Huge corporations owning
our data, our digital selves. Yes: **our online identity is no
longer ours**. Are we willing to accept that?
This blog starts as my quest to find answers to that question.

See you on `the Indie Web <https://indiewebify.me/>`_.
