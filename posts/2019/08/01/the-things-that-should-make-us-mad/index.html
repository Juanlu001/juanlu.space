      <div class="entry-content e-content">
        <p>As anybody who regularly watches the news knows, there is no shortage of
reasons to be mad. Yet precisely because of this sheer amount of
information <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>, it's also easy to live in an anesthetized status, in which
all the horrible things that happen in the world far away from home look
like background noise. Because of this, sometimes we need a trigger - we
need to pick a particular thing to be mad at.</p>
<p>This week I found mine, and I am enraged.</p>
<p>GitHub.com, the largest code sharing platform in the world and, besides,
home to this humble blog and virtually all my open source work, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/Hamed/status/1154268514074660864">started
blocking users from Iran and other
countries</a>
somewhere around July 25th, 2019. As Nat Friedman, GitHub's CEO,
confirmed some days later, the company was not offered <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1155311124687945728">&quot;the option to
give anyone advance notice of
restrictions&quot;</a>,
which prevented the banned developers to take actions to protect their
projects, such as making their repositories public.</p>
<p>For one, not everybody wants (or can) make their repositories public,
and apart from that it's important to note that there is <strong>a lot of
data</strong> on GitHub repositories that is not code, namely issues, pull
requests conversations, wikis, and possibly more. That data is no longer
accessible for the people that produced it.</p>
<p>The reasons for these bans are explained <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-and-trade-controls">on this GitHub
page</a>,
and can be summarized in this sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
U.S. trade control laws restrict what GitHub.com services can be
made available to users in certain countries and territories.</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, under current USA trade law, GitHub is forced to restrict
access to their services in a bunch of countries, somewhat overlapping
with what George W. Bush infamously called the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;. According
to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wm.edu/offices/techtransfer/ExportControls/Regulations/OFAC/index.php">Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)
website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Currently, sanctioned countries include the Balkans, Belarus, Burma,
Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Iran, Iraq, Liberia, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe.</blockquote>
<p>Without trying to get a 100 % understanding about the reach of these
sanctions, it's anyway important to note that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/United_States_sanctions">it's a complex
matter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Combined, the Treasury Department, the Commerce Department and the
State Department list embargoes against 30 countries or territories</blockquote>
<p>I leave this bit of information here before I get emotional about Iran
in particular later on. Do not forget that there are more countries
affected.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="GitHub ban note" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us/master/message.png" />
<p class="caption">GitHub ban note</p>
</div>
<p><em>However</em>, even though these restrictions should be clearly applied
according to location and not nationality, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us">the situation is much
worse</a> (emphasis
mine):</p>
<blockquote>
GitHub decided to take one step further and ban every user that used
Iran's IP address <strong>somewhere their history no matter where she/he
is living</strong></blockquote>
<p>USA applying economic sanctions to countries is by no means a new
phenomenon. For example, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Iran_and_Libya_Sanctions_Act">Iran and Libya Sanctions Act
(ILSA)</a>
dates from 1996. We could write a million words about how suspiciously
selective the USA government are when picking which countries to
sanction, or in general about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Operation_Condor">some aspects of their foreign
policy</a>, which in part
brought us to where we are now. Thus, by speaking about this particular
topic (the GitHub bans), I am no way trying to minimize major issues
that affect people's lives in more severe ways.</p>
<p>I am picking my reason to be mad.</p>
<div class="section" id="freedom-of-choice">
<h2>Freedom of choice</h2>
<p>In the second quarter of 2019, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#/2019">5 biggest companies by market
capitalization</a>
are USA tech companies: Microsoft (owner of GitHub), Amazon.com, Apple
Inc., Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google) and Facebook. Only one of
them manufactures objects you can touch, the rest being software,
services, and micro-targeted advertising.</p>
<p>The fact that all the companies that dictate how the Western world
interacts with technology are based in the USA means that we are forced
to abide by their rules of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275114/facebook-community-guidelines-nipples-nudity">how the female body is
portrayed</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">how people of color are (not) taken into account when building
user-facing
products</a>,
and many more subtleties.</p>
<p>Therefore, the consequences of this dominance of USA-based companies are
far reaching, but <a class="reference external" href="https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-the-big-five-tech-giants-from-my-life-it-was-hel-1831304194">trying to live without them is so difficult that it's
not even
funny</a>,
and the reasons for that are related to how tech companies make use of
cloud services. For example, Spotify S. A. is a Swedish company but
<a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/spotify-chooses-google-cloud-platform-to-power-data-infrastructure">they store their data in Google Cloud
Storage</a>,
and so the theoretical advantages of being in the European Union vanish.</p>
<p>The five big tech giants, and with them the USA and their morals, have
effectively monopolized the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-mad">
<h2>Getting mad</h2>
<p>I first started getting mad at the USA economic sanctions during my
first year as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ie.edu/school-human-sciences-technology/we-are-hst/people/faculty/juan-luis-cano-rodriguez/">Associate Professor of several Python subjects at IE
School of Human Sciences and
Technology</a>.
I am lucky to have about 55 students from literally everywhere in the
world and to be about the same age than my students, which makes the
interaction with them extremely enriching and eye opening.</p>
<p>As part of the course, I encourage my students to participate in Kaggle
competitions, which involve complex data science and machine learning
problems in a healthy and competitive environment. At some point though,
some event that I can't remember (not sure if the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_genocide">Rohingya genocide in
Myanmar</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2017_Venezuelan_constitutional_crisis">2017
Venezuelan Constitutional
crisis</a>
or the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2017%E2%80%9318_Iranian_protests">2017-2018 Iranian
protests</a>)
triggered me and made me think that, Kaggle being in the USA, there was
probably some restrictions to the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/terms">And I was right</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Competitions are open to residents of the United States and
worldwide, except if you are a resident of Crimea, Cuba, Iran,
Syria, North Korea, Sudan, or any other place prohibited by law you
may not enter any Competition.</blockquote>
<p>I had students from Iran at the time, and reading this sentence made me
furious. I tried looking into another platforms and found DrivenData,
whose slogan is &quot;Data science competitions to build a better world&quot; and
has a focus on social impact and sustainable development goals, but it
turns out it was <a class="reference external" href="https://www.drivendata.org/termsofuse/#governing-law-and-jurisdiction">subject to the same
restrictions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
We make no claims that the Website or any of its content is
accessible or appropriate outside of the United States. Access to
the Website may not be legal by certain persons or in certain
countries.</blockquote>
<p>At this point I gave up and offered an apology to my students.
Fortunately, <em>according to the text</em>, nobody should have problems using
the platforms from Spain, which is where the class take place, so I
called it a day.</p>
<p>However, fast forward to 2019, and now there's a real possibility that
some of my students won't be able to access <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Juanlu001/ie-mbd-advanced-python/">the materials of my
courses</a> if
they ever visited any of the sanctioned countries <em>in the past</em> just
because, at the time of writing, they are hosted on GitHub. Also,
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/Hamed/status/1154500430317182976">GitLab.com is not an option because it uses Google
Cloud</a>.
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/Hamed/status/1154500430317182976">Neither are Bitbucket nor
SourceForge</a>.</p>
<p>You guessed it right: I am mad as hell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-need-alternatives">
<h2>We need alternatives</h2>
<p>If you have been reading carefully, you will have noticed that the
GitHub restrictions affect &quot;access to private repository services and
paid services&quot;, so in theory nobody should have problems to access these
materials. I am not over dramatizing in bad faith, but to get my point
across: what if I ask them to create a private repository for an
assignment? What if they want to use the paid services for any reason?
What if the <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/">Orange in Chief</a>
declares war to Iran in a series of angry tweets and the sanctions get
worse? <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
<p>For the time being, I will do everything I can with the time and
resources I have (one month) to avoid putting any of my future students
in a situation where they are at disadvantage with respect to their
colleagues. This might or might not involve making the materials
available in a self-hosted git web UI (GitLab, Gitea) and making it
useable enough so that all the development can happen there. Or I can
use platforms like <a class="reference external" href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a>, a hosted Gitea
service backed by <a class="reference external" href="https://codeberg.org/codeberg/org/src/branch/master/Imprint.md">a non-profit organisation based in
Germany</a>
that promoted themselves among all this crisis. And of course, whatever
I build in the future, I will be careful to consider <a class="reference external" href="https://fuga.cloud/">non-USA cloud
providers as well</a>.</p>
<p>So, now that I told you what <em>I</em> am going to do, I think it's important
to think about what <em>we</em>, the people that can't change the course of the
USA foreign policy (either because we are not decision makers or because
we can't even vote the current ones out) are going to do. We <em>need</em> to
have a deep conversation about the alternatives to the current
situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ramblings-a-few-questions-and-no-answers">
<h2>Ramblings, a few questions, and no answers</h2>
<p>Some people will happily state that we <strong>just</strong> have to host our own
GitLab/Gitea/whatever, but please bear with me if I'm wary of <a class="reference external" href="https://saynotostigma.com/2015/09/the-j-word-just-think-about-it/">the
J-word</a>.
Also, without seamless model for <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;tamanning/nomadic-identity-brought-to-you-by-hubzilla-67eadce13c3b">nomadic
identities</a>
that do not make me give my email and password to an unbounded number of
small, volunteer-run code sharing websites, not to mention being able to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/177">easily migrate my data to another instance in case one goes
down</a> or a way to
aggregate the costs in managing email servers (read: SPAM), storage,
security upgrades in a way that they devolve upon all these atomized
efforts, I argue that this approach will never be a real alternative,
let alone compete with the status quo.</p>
<p>Some other people have declared that Blockchain and distributed ledger
technologies will fix this issue. I don't know enough about these kind
of technologies to make an informed judgement, so I only have uninformed
opinions: I am worried that these solutions end up being backed by
venture capital money (which, by their own nature, strive to maximize
profits over short periods of time), that they end up being too complex
(and difficult to replicate without the required skills), or that it's
another instance of tech people trying to fix societal problems adding
more layers of technology and ignoring any other branch of knowledge
(&quot;when you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot;).</p>
<p>Perhaps EU-based, non-profit organisations like Codeberg are the
answers, but of course being based in the EU is &quot;good enough&quot; to me only
because it <em>seems</em> better than the USA in this respect and because I
have my own biases (disclaimer: I'm a EU citizen). In fact, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/iran/">the EU has
its own battery of sanctions against
Iran</a>,
although on quick inspection they do not seem to affect general purpose
online services or businesses. In any case, perhaps being attached to
any particular legislation is not good enough, which brings us back to
the Blockchain, or at least should make us consider how do we enable
groups of people to create platforms that are big enough so they don't
incur in a massive overhead of administrative costs and that can be set
up and accessed anywhere.</p>
<p>The conundrum of the current GitHub bans is rooted in USA <em>trade laws</em>,
which means that perhaps a Foundation or any other form of non-profit
entity would not be forced to impose such restrictions. How would EU
non-profits and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cooperative">cooperatives</a> by a similar
breed of sanctions? These kind of questions are the reason why tech
people must work together with people with diverse backgrounds and
skills (Social Sciences, Humanities, Law, Philosophy, all of them!)</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions and very few answers, but if you stayed this
long I hope I got you thinking about what to do. It's already bad enough
that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.acslaw.org/expertforum/trumps-travel-ban-two-years-later/">some people can't go back to their home countries and then return
to where they make a
living</a>,
so we owe our friends, our students, our colleagues, a better
alternative.</p>
<p>Are you mad already? Then let's do something about it.</p>
