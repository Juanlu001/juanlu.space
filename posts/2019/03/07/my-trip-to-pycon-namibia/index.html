      <div class="entry-content e-content">
        <p>Since I went to my first Python Conference in 2013 (coincidentally, one
that I kicked off and helped organize with no other references:
<a class="reference external" href="http://2013.es.pycon.org/">PyCon Spain</a>) I have been lucky
enough to travel to many other conferences around the world, always
giving a talk or participating in some way. Some of these events were in
places far away from my home town, and these, in particular, brought
mesmerizing experiences that I will always remember. After being invited
to the <a class="reference external" href="http://scipyla.org/conf/2015/">first SciPy Latin America</a> in
2015 in Posadas, Argentina and the second <a class="reference external" href="http://cusol.uis.edu.co/clibre2/">Free Culture
Festival</a> in 2017 in Bucaramanga,
Colombia, it was about time for another groundbreaking trip. And the
<a class="reference external" href="https://na.pycon.org/">fifth PyCon Namibia</a> exceeded all my
expectations.</p>
<p>And also made my head explode several times.</p>
<div class="section" id="burning-prejudices-to-the-ground">
<h2>Burning prejudices to the ground</h2>
<p>I first heard from PyCon Namibia in <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/LJ2zRHociVw?t=805">a lightning talk at EuroPython
2016</a> by Daniele Procida,
community manager at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.divio.com/">Divio</a> and
wonderful ambassador. That was three years ago, and I still remember my
head exploding with questions (&quot;a PyCon in Africa?&quot;, &quot;50 % women
attendees? that must be the most diverse PyCon in the world!&quot;) while
enjoying Daniele's exquisite sense of humor.</p>
<p>From that point, I <em>knew</em> I <strong>had</strong> to go. But when, and how? Every year
I checked PyCon Namibia's website to realize that... could not make it
<em>that</em> February. At some point the planets aligned, and I knew 2019
would be <em>that</em> year: I bought my ticket to the conference, donated
another one, waited for someone to respond to my inquiry email, and
booked my plane. I was going to a tech conference in Sub-Saharian
Africa, and I could not be more excited.</p>
<p>But the surprises were just about to start.</p>
<blockquote>
(2019-02-16) &quot;Doha, 01:24 local time. I am about to board to Namibia,
and <em>we are all white</em>. Something is not quite right here.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>All I knew about Namibia came from Wikipedia: a relatively young
country, doing reasonably well from an economic point of view, English
as the official language (weird)... But suddenly, my population sample of
Namibian citizens going back home (leaving aside a bunch of tourists,
probably going to a safari) was all white, and I could only hear German
and Afrikaans. The idea that maybe people of color in Namibia perhaps
could not afford air travel felt revolting, and I just wanted to land
and get back to &quot;reality&quot;.</p>
<p>There's no picture from my arrival to Namibia. I wanted to avoid
distractions from my smartphone and hear, see and feel everything.</p>
<p>Daniele and Adam were waiting for me at the airport, and we had a great
time the first two days, which were essential for me to <em>break all the
rules</em>: I drank ice, I ate worms, I wore short sleeve, I didn't smear
myself in mosquito repellent. Yes: I also felt like a stupid, fearful
tourist for not realizing that Windhoek, the capital city of Namibia, is
just a normal city, unlike how it's depicted in some &quot;travel
recommendation&quot; guides or vaccination leaflets.</p>
<p>Adam taught me an important lesson in Namibia: while talking to him
about self-censorship and shitty interactions with strangers on Twitter,
and the fact that I had been considering creating a bot that would
remove my tweets after some days, he just said: <strong>&quot;own your actions&quot;</strong>.
That left me thinking the whole trip, and the result is that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.juanlu.space/posts/2019/02/24/my-digital-self/">I deleted
my personal Twitter account and started this
blog</a>.</p>
<p>You guessed right: my head was exploding.</p>

<div class="section" id="sheer-contrast">
<h2>Sheer contrast</h2>
<p>What comes next are my raw (translated) notes from a trip we did the day
before the conference. I hope you can forgive my naÃ¯vetÃ©: I was still a
stupid, fearful traveler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2019-02-18) &quot;Around 13:00, we arrive in Katutura. I don't understand
a word, but there's a great atmosphere. I'm a bit worried about the
meat, not sure what to do. Two young girls are eating it without
trouble... I might die of diarrhea, but this is delicious.</p>
<p>Barefoot girls, their parents are sewing. Lots of places to shave off
and get a haircut, they look like meeting places where people just go
and talk. The street market is very clean.</p>
<p>A man uttering something makes us uncomfortable. Do we bother him
with our presence? Jessica [our guide and PyConNA co-organizer, more
on her later] doesn't seem impressed.</p>
<p>The Sun burns, but the dressmakers need a lightbulb to see what
they're doing because everything is covered and a bit dark. Their
language is called Otjiherero, from the &quot;Herero&quot; tribe.</p>
<p>Right behind me, a man yells: 'You are limited to grow higher because
you have no money!'</p>
<p>The strange man keeps uttering things around us, hitting his chest.
The dressmakers are amused. I'm not sure if anyone actually
understands him.</p>
<p>'The currency for herero is cattle.'</p>
<p>The dressmakers sweat to the lightbulb while we observe. The dress
progresses slowly, layer by layer. Can you imagine that in reality they don't
dress like that and everything is a joke to make fun of tourists,
easily impressed?</p>
<p>Sandrine has become a local attraction. A man approached to ask how
much he likes the combination between the dress and her skin color
for a wedding. 'Now we only need a husband.'</p>
<p>Goodbye = Peri nawa Thank you = Ndangi, Okuhepa Hi = Kora I'm good =
Nawa</p>
<p>15:00 - My hands are stained with clay. The clay with which the women
that danced for us cover their body. We didn't understand the rules,
or the rhythm, or the language, but we danced with them nonetheless.
They explained the clothes they wear when reaching adulthood, when
they marry, when their parents die. And they asked the same to us.
Meanwhile, lots of children around us were listening with an
expression of amazement in their faces, as if all of that was new to
them as well. When they were satisfied, the natives shook our hands
and left. My hands are stained with clay, and tomorrow I'm going to a
tech conference.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's clay in the notebook as well. I'm glad I stamped my hand in it,
so I never forget the feeling.</p>

<div class="section" id="pycon-namibia">
<h2>PyCon Namibia</h2>
<p>And finally, the big day arrived. We enjoyed three exciting days
learning and sharing about Python, and much more than that. I ended up
participating a lot:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I gave an <strong>introduction to Python workshop</strong> focused on having
everyone with a working environment, probably the most challenging
part when getting started with the language. We had to tweak the
<tt class="docutils literal">PATH</tt> in non-trivial ways by following ugly tutorials, learn how
to copy-paste from the Windows command line (spoiler: it's a very
crappy experience) and be very patient, but in the end, everybody
could <tt class="docutils literal">pip install</tt> libraries and configure their editor of choice.
In the last minute, I came up with the idea of taking questions from
the audience of the form &quot;how do you do X with Python&quot; because I
happen to know a lot of libraries and projects (even though I never
used most of them of course). It turned out to be quite interesting:
we mentioned <a class="reference external" href="https://www.xlwings.org/">xlwings</a> for Excel
automation, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pygame.org/">pygame</a> for animations and
games, <a class="reference external" href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/">Selenium</a> for
browser automation and frontend testing, and many more I can't
remember.</li>
<li>A speaker couldn't make it to Namibia because of last-minute visa
issues, so I gave a talk about <strong>Jupyter notebooks and reproducible
science</strong>
(<a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/astrojuanlu/jupyter-ipython-how-a-notebook-is-changing-science">slides</a>)
which I used to give some years ago when IPython started to be
popular and Jupyter was created. An adorable girl that asked me &quot;what
are those 'bugs' you mention all the time&quot; and I answered with all
seriousness because I'm aware how important it is not to dismiss
these sort of &quot;simple&quot; questions, especially when you are still young
and curious about the universe. She was for sure not alone, but only
she dared to speak up and ask. I love working with teenagers and
children because of this. She also asked what &quot;aerospace engineers&quot;
do... Which is probably one of the toughest questions one can ask to
me. But that's another story.</li>
<li>I gave a talk about <strong>poliastro, the Python library for
Astrodynamics</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.poliastro.space/">website</a>) I
created many years ago and that I still maintain and develop. As
usual there were only a few people in the audience because many feel
intimidated about space stuff, but even so, I had a great interaction
with the people that stayed. We discussed the challenges of creating
a community around an open source project, the difficulties in
validating research software... And of course, the African space
program! A girl told me that thanks to my talk she was considering
working in the space industry again and that alone made all the trip
worth it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the talks and workshops I gave, it was exciting to have
<strong>Adam Johnson</strong> talking about how to use power law distributions to
predict which technologies will still be around in the near future,
<strong>Ngatatue Mate</strong> teaching us how to make music in Python using
<a class="reference external" href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://foxdot.org/">FoxDot</a> (really, never had so much fun in <em>any</em>
PyCon), <strong>Godwin Nekongo</strong> eloquently introducing the <a class="reference external" href="https://pynamibia.org/scholars/">PyNam
Scholars</a>, <strong>Adeshola Afolabi</strong>
describing how to conduct proper A/B testing in Python (perhaps one day
I'll get my stats straight and fully understand the whole thing).</p>
<p>What made this PyCon extraordinary to me was the lightning talks. Not
because they were funnier than others, but because they were the perfect
excuse for the young people in the audience to share their excitement to
be there, to learn how to use technology to improve their lives, how
skeptical they were about the event before going, how eager they were
about going to hands-on workshops to actually code themselves. They
eloquently described the struggles of their own country and their will
to make their voices heard. I was literally moved to tears.</p>

<div class="section" id="and-now-what">
<h2>And now what?</h2>
<p>After the conference, I didn't really have time to get bored. We recited
poetry. We fed cheetahs and leopards. We pushed a van with an empty
tank. I met artists. I felt this combination of excitement and
exhaustion that one always has after sharing and learning so much.</p>
<p>And now, what?</p>
<p>If Daniele Procida is the European ambassador of PyCon Namibia,
Jessica Upani is the power that drives it.
I had the opportunity to meet her in person and understand why
some emails took a while to be answered: <em>she was organizing the
conference almost on her own</em>. And yet, it was amazing how much positive
energy she had and how much their students admired her.</p>
<p>Jessica gave her first talk the last day of the PyCon, explaining how to
organize one. And she had only one request: that, <strong>two weeks from
then</strong>, all those interested in making the next edition happen should
commit to dedicating as much time as she did (ideally less if more people
were involved!) and write her an email. Not earlier, because all this
excitement can be deceiving, and make us think we want to work more than
we actually can afford after it's gone.</p>
<p>Well, can you guess what day today is?</p>
<p>Get your hands dirty. Lift others. Own your actions. Attend <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/pyconafrica">PyCon
Africa 2019</a>. Organize PyCon Namibia
2020.</p>
<p>Make your head explode.</p>
